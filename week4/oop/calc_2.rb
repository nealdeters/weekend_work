# In the previous exercise, you were asked to DRY up your code (remove duplicated code)
# by using Inheritance. In this exercise, you must DRY up your code 
# a different technique using Composition. Hint: Google 'Ruby Mixin Module'. (Using
# mixin modules is how you achieve Composition with Ruby.)

  def multiply(first_number, second_number)
    first_number * second_number

# Copy your driver code from the previous exercise below:

p calc.add(1,2)
p calc.subtract(4,1)
p calc.multiply(2,2)
p calc.divide(4,2)
p calc.square_root(16)
